# Active learning literature

This page is here to collect summaries of papers that focus on active learning.
The idea is to share knowledge on recent developments in active learning.

If you've read a paper recently, write a little summary in markdown, put it in
the folder `docs/research/literature` and make a pull request. You can even do all of
that right in the Github web UI!
