# Bayesian deep active learning research

Research in this field is quite dynamic with multiple labs around the world working on this problem.

In a nutshell, we want to:

> Optimize labelling by maximizing the information obtained after each label.
    
Another critical goal of our research is to better understand the sampling bias active learning creates. 
Recent research has shown that active learning creates more balanced, fairer datasets.

We strongly suggest to go through our [literature review](./literature/index.md).
