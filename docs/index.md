# Welcome to Baal (**ba**yesian **a**ctive **l**earning)

Baal is a Bayesian active learning library.
We provide methods to estimate sampling from the posterior distribution
in order to maximize the efficiency of labelling during active learning. Our library is suitable for research and industrial applications.

To know more on what is Bayesian active learning, see our [User guide](user_guide/index.md).

We are a member of Pytorch's ecosystem, and we welcome contributions from the community.
If you have any question, we are reachable on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/baal-world/shared_invite/zt-z0izhn4y-Jt6Zu5dZaV2rsAS9sdISfg).
