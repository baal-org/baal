Baal is an active learning library initially developed at
[ElementAI](https://www.elementai.com/) (acquired by ServiceNow in 2021).

Our goal is to support both industrial applications and research in active learning.

Read the documentation at https://baal.readthedocs.io.

Our paper can be read on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.09916). It includes tips and tricks to make active learning
usable in production.

For a quick introduction to Baal and Bayesian active learning, please see these links:

* [Bayesian active learning presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13UUDsS1rvqDnXza7L0j4bnqyhOT5TDSt/view?usp=sharing)

## Installation and requirements

Baal requires `Python>=3.7`.

To install Baal using pip: `pip install baal`

We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as our package manager.
To install Baal from source: `poetry install`

# What is active learning?

Active learning is a special case of machine learning in which a learning algorithm is able to interactively query the
user (or some other information source) to obtain the desired outputs at new data points
(to understand the concept in more depth, refer to our [tutorial](https://baal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)).

## Baal Framework

At the moment Baal supports the following methods to perform active learning.

- Monte-Carlo Dropout (Gal et al. 2015)
- MCDropConnect (Mobiny et al. 2019)
- Deep ensembles
- Semi-supervised learning

If you want to propose new methods, please submit an issue.

The **Monte-Carlo Dropout** method is a known approximation for Bayesian neural networks. In this method, the Dropout
layer is used both in training and test time. By running the model multiple times whilst randomly dropping weights, we
calculate the uncertainty of the prediction using one of the uncertainty measurements
in [heuristics.py](baal/active/heuristics/heuristics.py).

The framework consists of four main parts, as demonstrated in the flowchart below:

- ActiveLearningDataset
- Heuristics
- ModelWrapper
- ActiveLearningLoop

<p align="center">

</p>

To get started, wrap your dataset in our _[**ActiveLearningDataset**](baal/active/dataset.py)_ class. This will ensure
that the dataset is split into
`training` and `pool` sets. The `pool` set represents the portion of the training set which is yet to be labelled.

We provide a lightweight object _[**ModelWrapper**](baal/modelwrapper.py)_ similar to `keras.Model` to make it easier to
train and test the model. If your model is not ready for active learning, we provide Modules to prepare them.

For example, the _[**MCDropoutModule**](baal/bayesian/dropout.py)_ wrapper changes the existing dropout layer to be used
in both training and inference time and the `ModelWrapper` makes the specifies the number of iterations to run at
training and inference.

In conclusion, your script should be similar to this:

```python
dataset = ActiveLearningDataset(your_dataset)
dataset.label_randomly(INITIAL_POOL)  # label some data
model = MCDropoutModule(your_model)
model = ModelWrapper(model, your_criterion)
active_loop = ActiveLearningLoop(dataset,
                                 get_probabilities=model.predict_on_dataset,
                                 heuristic=heuristics.BALD(shuffle_prop=0.1),
                                 query_size=NDATA_TO_LABEL)
for al_step in range(N_ALSTEP):
    model.train_on_dataset(dataset, optimizer, BATCH_SIZE, use_cuda=use_cuda)
    if not active_loop.step():
        # We're done!
        break
```

For a complete experiment, we provide _[experiments/](experiments/)_ to understand how to write an active training
process. Generally, we use the **ActiveLearningLoop**
provided at _[src/baal/active/active_loop.py](baal/active/active_loop.py)_. This class provides functionality to get the
predictions on the unlabeled pool after each (few) epoch(s) and sort the next set of data items to be labeled based on
the calculated uncertainty of the pool.

### Re-run our Experiments

```bash
docker build [--target base_baal] -t baal .
docker run --rm baal --gpus all python3 experiments/vgg_mcdropout_cifar10.py 
```

### Use Baal for YOUR Experiments

Simply clone the repo, and create your own experiment script similar to the example
at [experiments/vgg_experiment.py](experiments/vgg_experiment.py). Make sure to use the four main parts of Baal
framework. _Happy running experiments_
